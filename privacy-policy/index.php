                            <p>I am committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. All personal identity information that you choose to provide to me while using this website, will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.</p>

                                <li>I am thoughtful about the personal information I ask you to provide and the personal information that I collect about you through the operation of my services.</li>
                                <li>I store personal information for only as long as I have a reason to keep it.</li>
                                <li>I aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information I collect and to remove information you request to have removed.</li>

                            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that I collect about you when you visit my website (<a href="https://www.rebeccamagar.com">www.rebeccamagar.com</a>).</p>
                            <h3>Information I collect</h3>
                            <p>I only collect information about you if I have a reason to do so–for example, to provide my services, to communicate with you, or to make my website better.</p>
                            <p>I collect information in two ways: if and when you provide information to me, and automatically through operating my services. Let's go over the information that I collect.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Name</li>
                                <li>Contact information including your email address</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Information you provide to me</h4>
                            <p>It's probably no surprise that I collect information that you provide to me. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how I use the information. For example:</p>

                                <li>Communications with me (Hi there!): You may provide me with information when you communicate directly with me via me contact form, or by contacting me through other means.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Information I Collect Automatically</h4>
                            <p>I also collect some information automatically:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Log information: Like most online service providers, I collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. I collect log information when you use my website–for example, when you send a message through my contact form or login to my portfolio.</li>
                                <li>Usage information: I collect information about your usage of my services. For example, I collect information about what happens when you use my website (e.g., page views, form submissions, etc.) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). I use this information to, for example, provide my services to you, as well as get insights on how people use my website so I can make my website better.</li>
                                <li>Location information: I may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. I collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit my website from certain geographic regions.</li>
                                <li>Information from cookies and other technologies: A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. I use cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help me identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for my website.

                            <h4>Purposes for Using Information</h4>
                            <p>I use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To provide my services–for example, to connect with you to discuss job opportunities;</li>
                                <li>To further develop and improve my website–for example by adding new features that I think my users will enjoy or that will help them to use my website more efficiently;</li>

                            <p>A note here for those in the European Union about my legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that my use of your information is based on the grounds that:</p>
                            <p>(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill my commitments to you or is necessary in order to enable access to my website on your device; or</p>
                            <p>(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or</p>
                            <p>(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or</p>
                            <p>(4) I have a legitimate interest in using your information–for example, to provide and update my services, to improve my services so that I can offer you a better user experience, to safeguard my services, to communicate with you, to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of my website, to better understand user retention and attrition, to monitor and prevent any problems with my website, and to personalize your experience; or</p>
                            <p>(5) You have given me your consent–for example before I place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on, as described in my <a href="#cookies">Cookie Policy</a> below.</p>

                            <p>I share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>
                            <p><strong>Third party vendors:</strong> I may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to me, or to provide their services to you. This group includes vendors that help me provide my services to you (like email delivery services that help me stay in touch with you, registrars, registries, and data escrow services that allow my website to function, my hosting provider to troubleshoot website problems, those that help me understand and enhance my website - like analytics providers), who may need information to, for example, provide technical or other support services. I require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.</p>

                            <p><strong>To protect rights, property, and others:</strong> I may disclose information about you when I believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of myself, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if I have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, I may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</p>
                            <p><strong>With your consent:</strong> I may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, I may share your information with third parties with which you authorize me to do so.</p>

                            <h4>What Are Cookies?</h4>
                            <p>Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to “remember” you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a “session cookie”) or for multiple repeat visits (using a “persistent cookie”). They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in. Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as “first party cookies”), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website (“third party cookies”).</p>
                            <p>Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as “web beacons” or “pixels.” These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way. As a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted.</p>
                            <h4>How I Use Cookies</h4>
                            <p>I use cookies for a number of different purposes. Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons, while some enable a personalized experience for visitors. Some of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a visitor takes a particular action.</p>
                            <p>Many of the cookies I use are only set if you are logging into the site (so you don't have to log in every time, for example), while others are set whenever you visit my website, irrespective of whether you have an account.</p>

                            <h4>Types of Cookies</h4>

                            <h3>How Long I Keep Information</h3>
                            <p>I generally discard information about you when I no longer need the information for the purposes for which I collect and use it–which are described in the section above on <a href="#howandwhy">How and Why I Use Information</a>–and I am not legally required to continue to keep it.</p>
                            <p>For example, I keep the web server logs that record information about a visitor to my website, such as the visitor's IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. I retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to my website and investigate issues if something goes wrong on my website.</p>

                            <p>While no online service is 100% secure, I work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring my services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks, implementing firewall protection, protecting forms with CAPTCHA, and keeping my technologies updated and maintained.</p>
                            <h3>Choices</h3>
                            <p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
                            <p>Limit the information that you provide: You can choose not to provide optional contact information when you connect with me. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, I may be unable to reach you–for example, to respond to messages you send to me.</p>
