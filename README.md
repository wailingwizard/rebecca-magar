# Rebecca Magar's Professional Portfolio
Hello! I'm a designer and front-end developer who's been creating meaningful experiences through design and code for over 16 years. I love tackling design and development projects with a focus on collaboration, creativity, and practical solutions that meet both user needs and business goals. When I'm not busy at work, you can catch me jamming on my drums and peddling my art.
